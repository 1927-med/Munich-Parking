# Munich-Parking Project

Welcome to the Munich-Parking project! This project aims to develop a parking app that allows users to find parking spots, make reservations, and make payments.
This app is a project I am working on in my spare time to learn more about web and app development. If you notice any issues, please let me know. I am always happy to take input.
Also its my first time working with python I expect to encounter many problems in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

This app is called, Munich-Parking. The name as you can see from the title is a parking app that is designed to serve the city of Munich. Its main aim is to solve the parking shortages drivers face in Munich. I am implmenting a very basic feature and I will add on features as we go along. There will be people who can or want to share thier parking space to gain extra money. They are mostly people who either have an allocated parking space either in a garage in their apartment or house. When they leave for work or for any reason that makes them stay in another location for many hours they can share their parking space. In order to do that they will need to provide the paper or any license that shows they are the owners of that space and they will have to register it with my app along with their detail information including their IBAN/ bank account. They then will have the option to choose to accept or decline when a driver who is looking for a space requests it and it shows up to them via a push notification, if they enable the push notification. The owners will be able to see the stars or review of the customers who want to use their parking space, the type of car and license plate. They will also see for how long the customer wants to rent the parking space. When they accept the offer they usually have to see the car arriving at the location if they want. I am not sure if this will be implemented in the future.
Once the customer parks their car they will have to start the button and when the owner also confirms it, it will start a countdown timer that works synchronously to both parties.

For the customers or drivers who want to use this app they first have to log in their details and email and verfication just as the owners and then choose which mode they want it will show up either as Renter or Driver. They are also able to see if the renters are online or not. They select in an interactive map or they can also just type in the name of the street they want to park and it will show them the free areas to which they can book their guarenteed parking space. They will sign up by uploading their drivers licence, personal information address etc and set up a password or enable facial recognition. Then they have to give their bank details and IBAN. Then they have to sign a sepa mandate that allows the app to take money from their bank in form of penalties if they fail to stay longer than the agreed time.
